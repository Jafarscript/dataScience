## Hello World!

**Hello World** is often the first program you write in any programming language. It's a simple program that outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console. In Python, you can achieve this with a single line of code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

- `print()`: This function is used to display text or data on the screen. You can pass a string or other data types as arguments to `print()` to display them.

## Arithmetic Operations

Python supports a variety of arithmetic operations for performing mathematical calculations. Here are some common arithmetic operations and their usage:

- **Addition (+):** Used to add two or more numbers together.

  ```python
  result = 5 + 3  # result will be 8
  ```

- **Subtraction (-):** Used to subtract one number from another.

  ```python
  result = 10 - 7  # result will be 3
  ```

- **Multiplication (*):** Used to multiply two or more numbers.

  ```python
  result = 4 * 6  # result will be 24
  ```

- **Division (/):** Used to divide one number by another. It returns a float result.

  ```python
  result = 8 / 2  # result will be 4.0
  ```

- **Integer Division (//):** Used to perform integer division, which returns the quotient as an integer.

  ```python
  result = 8 // 3  # result will be 2
  ```

- **Modulo (%):** Used to find the remainder when one number is divided by another.

  ```python
  result = 10 % 3  # result will be 1
  ```

- **Exponentiation (**):** Used to raise a number to a power.

  ```python
  result = 2 ** 3  # result will be 8
  ```

## Variables

In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. They act as named containers for values, allowing you to store and manipulate information easily. Here's how you can work with variables:

- **Variable Assignment:** To assign a value to a variable, you use the `=` operator.

  ```python
  age = 30
  ```

- **Variable Naming Rules:** Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. They are case-sensitive.

  ```python
  name = "Alice"
  _score = 95
  ```

- **Variable Reassignment:** You can change the value stored in a variable by reassigning it.

  ```python
  age = 30
  age = 31  # Reassigning age to a new value
  ```

- **Variable Types:** Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type of a variable explicitly. Python determines the type based on the value assigned.

  ```python
  name = "Alice"  # name is a string
  age = 30       # age is an integer
  ```

These concepts are fundamental to getting started with Python programming. You can use variables to store data, perform arithmetic operations, and display results using the `print()` function.
